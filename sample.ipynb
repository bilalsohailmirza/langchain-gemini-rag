However, most of what we know about software-\\nengineering expertise are vague stereotypes, such as ‘excellent \\ncommunicators’ and ‘great teammates’. The lack of specificity in \\nour understanding hinders researchers from reasoning about \\nthem, employers from identifying them, and young engineers from \\nbecoming them. Our understanding also lacks breadth:  what are \\nall the distinguishing attributes of great engineers (technical \\nexpertise and beyond)? We took a first step in addressing these \\ngaps by interviewing 59 experienced engineers across 13 divisions \\nat Microsoft, uncovering 53 attributes of great engineers. We \\nexplain the attributes and examine how the most salient of these \\nimpact projects and teams . We discuss implications of this \\nknowledge on research and the hiring and training of engineers.  \\nIndex Terms— Software engineers, expertise, teamwork  \\nI. \\xa0INTRODUCTION \\nSoftware engineering research has considered a vast number \\nof factors th at affect project outcomes, from process and tools, \\nto programming languages and requirement elicitation. We \\nrarely give consideration, however, to one of the most \\nfundamental components of software engineering: the engineers \\nthemselves. Specifically, what makes a software engineer great? \\nThis basic question is at the foundation of nearly every part of \\nour world’s rapidly growing software ecosystem: employers \\nwant to hire and retain great engineers, universities want to train \\ngreat engineers, and young engineers want to become great. And \\nyet our understanding of what characteristics define software \\nengineering expertise still lacks specificity, breadth, and rigor.  \\nThe research we do have on this subject is directionally \\nsound, but often too indirect or abstract to form a foundational \\nunderstanding of software -engineering expertise. For example, \\nsome research has considered experiences of new hires  [1][2], \\nfinding that engineers need to contribute value to the team, not \\nbecome blocked (i.e. have self-efficacy and be persistent), and \\neffectively navigate large organizations. Other research hints at \\nimportant attributes, but only indirectly. For example, r esearch \\non te aching novices [3] and programmer productivity [4][5] \\nindicate experts are generally more productive : producing \\nsolutions faster, producing more in the same amount of time, \\nand/or having fewer bugs.  \\nSoftware engineering education research is another source of \\ninformation about software  engineering expertise, but it is \\nprescriptive rather than descriptive. For example, several studies \\nsuggest what ought to be in the ACM Computing Curricula  \\n[6][7][8][9], arguing that engineers need knowledge of technical \\nareas and techniques such as pro gramming fundamentals, \\nverification/validation, and project management. \\nIn this study, we sought to remedy the lack of specificity, \\nbreadth, and rigor  in prior wor k by investigating the following  \\nabout software engineers: \\n• \\xa0 What do expert software engineers think are attributes of \\ngreat software engineers?  \\n• \\xa0 Why are these attributes important for the engineering of \\nsoftware?  \\n• \\xa0 How do these attributes relate to each other?  \\nTo answer these questions, we performed 59 semi-structured \\ninterviews, spanning 13 Microsoft divisions, including several \\ninterviews with architect -level engineers with over 25 years of \\nexperience. The contribution of this effort is a thorough, specific, \\nand contextual understanding of software engineering expertise, \\nas viewed by expert software engineers.  \\nIn the rest of this paper, we detail our current understanding \\nof software engineering expertise. We then discuss our interview \\nand analysis methodology, the attributes we discovered, and the \\nimplications of this knowledge for software engineering  \\nresearch, practice, and training. \\nII. \\xa0RELATED WORK \\nMuch of  our knowledge of software engineering  expertise \\ncome from studying new engineers rather than experienced ones. \\nFor example, the closest work to ours is Hewner and Guzdi al’s \\ninvestigation of what employers in a small game company look \\nfor in new graduates [2]. The authors interviewed and surveyed \\nover 30 engineers, managers, and artists about qualifications for \\nrecent graduates. The authors identified programming skills as \\nwell as people skills, like the ‘ability to work with others and \\ncheck your ego at the door’. In addition to biases for the gaming \\nindustry, the authors also suggested differences in expectations \\nbetween new and senior hires. Begel and Simon’s 2008 ICER \\npaper performed a similar investigation  [1], follow ing 8 new  \\nhires at Microsoft for 4 weeks and  examining their daily task s. \\nThe authors found that novices need to identify ‘tasks that have \\nan impact’, to be ‘persistent’ (avoid lack of self-efficacy), and to \\ncollaborate effectively in a ‘large-scale software team setting’. \\nHowever, it was unclear whether experienced engineers ha d \\nsimilar issues.  \\nSome works are prescriptive, offering recommendations, but \\noften providing few insights into why  topics are (or are not) \\nimportant. For example, Lethbridge [10] surveyed 168 software \\nprofessionals about the relevance of computer science education \\ntopics from the ACM Computing Curricula  [6]. A notable \\nexception is Kelley’s work examining star performers, including \\nsoftware engineers at HP and Bell Labs [11]. The authors \\nprescribed nine working strategies and described how they lead \\nto high productivity— blazing trails, knowing who knows, \\n2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering\\n978-1-4799-1934-5/15 $31.00 © 2015 IEEE\\nDOI 10.1109/ICSE.2015.335\\n700\\n2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering\\n978-1-4799-1934-5/15 $31.00 © 2015 IEEE\\nDOI 10.1109/ICSE.2015.335\\n700\\n2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering\\n978-1-4799-1934-5/15 $31.00 © 2015 IEEE\\nDOI 10.1109/ICSE.2015.335\\n700\\nICSE 2015, Florence, Italy\\n       ��������������������������������������'),\n",

At OOPSLA 2003  [13], Brechner— a \\ndirector of development training at Microsoft — discussed the \\nneed for  design analysis, embracing diversity (e.g. other \\nnationalities), multidisciplinary project teaming, large -scale \\ndevelopment, and quality code. Dijkstra , in his Turing Award \\nspeech [14], argued that good developer s create obvious and \\nelegant solutions, constructed with provable correctness. These \\nattributes are likely important, but the luminaries were probably \\nnot aiming to exhaustively or rigorously identify key attributes. \\nPopular press and best-practice guides have also considered \\nthe topic. In a New York Times’ interview  [15], Bock—\\nGoogle’s vice president of people operations — indicated that a \\nsoftware engineer’s ability to learn on the job was critical , also  \\nclaiming that human judgment, inspiration, and cr eativity were \\nmore important than technical knowledge. Similarly, McConnell \\n[16] argued that effective developers, in addition to technical \\nskills, ha d various personality traits like being  humble about \\ntheir intelligence, curiosity, and intellectual honesty.  \\nComparisons of novices and expe rts also reveal insight into \\nsoftware engineering  expertise, showing that  experts are more \\nproductive, systematic, and well-prepared [3][17][18]. Sackman \\net al., in one of the first comparisons of developer productivity \\nin 1968 [5], found that completion times of programming and \\ndebugging tasks can vary as much as 28:1 between the best and \\nworst engineers.  Researchers also suggest qualitative and \\nenvironmental differences. Robillard et al. [19] found that \\neffective developers were more methodical and better at \\nrecognizing relevant information. Ericsson et al. [20]— origin of \\nthe meme that 10,000 hours of deliberate practice is needed to \\nachieve expertise— found that attaining expertise required time, \\nmaterials, teachers, and facilities.  \\nResearch into various aspects of teamwork suggest s other  \\nimportant attributes. Simon’s research into effective \\norganizations [21] argued that setting, communicati ng, and \\nalignment of goals within teams are important. Gobeli et al. [22] \\nfound that effective conflict management (e.g. confronting and \\ngive and take) are important for successful projects. Research on \\ncollaborations [23][24][25][26][27][28] suggests that expert \\nsoftware engineers have knowledge of code ownership , the \\ntechnical domain, and argumentation skills.  \\nWhile related research is extensive, few works directly \\naddress software engineering expertise. Those that do, focus on \\na narrow subset of factors. In our work, we give greater breadth, \\ndepth, and rigor to our understanding of software engineering  \\nexpertise than the current literature offers. \\nIII. \\xa0METHOD \\nIdeally, an empirical study of software engineering expertise \\nwould sample a wide -range of software companies, software \\nproducts, and company cultures. As an initial effort, we tried to \\napproximate the ideal by interviewing experienced engineers at \\nMicrosoft, a large company with a diverse set of software \\nproducts and engineers. We chose face -to-face semi-structured \\ninterviews to identify  an exhaustive list of attributes with \\ndetailed and contextualized understanding of their meaning and \\nimportance. \\nA key decision in our method was determining whose \\nsubjective opinions of software engineering  expertise could be \\nconsidered credible. Licensure and accreditation of engineers is \\nstill uncommon. The ACM's definition of software engineers as \\n'people who produce software for earnest use’ [6] is vague. We \\ntherefore used the approach utilized by researchers of human \\nexpertise [20], basing our definition of expertise on people \\nhaving achieved some degree of recognition as software \\nengineering experts. W e selected engineers at or above the \\nSoftware Development Engineer Level 2  (SDEII) title. T hese \\nengineers were confirmed as experts  by other engineers via the \\nhiring or promotion processes.  \\nBased on prior work, we aimed to obtain a stratified random \\nsample of engineers across two important dimensions: product \\ntype (10 major divisions at Microsoft plus one for all others \\nincluding Skype, Data C enter Ops, and Distribution) and \\nexperience level (‘experienced’— titles at or above SDEII— and \\n‘very experienced’— titles at or above Senior Dev Manager —\\ntypically with 15+ years of experience). We used the corporate \\naddress book, which the 1st author had access to as a full time \\nMicrosoft employee. We randomly sampled engineers in the 22 \\nstrata in a round -robin fashion with 3 employees each round, \\naiming for at least 2 informants in each strat um. Of the 152 \\nengineers we contacted, we interviewed 59 (39%), see Table 1. \\nThe interviews were semi -structured and about 1 hour in \\nduration. We started by describing our study, explaining how we \\nlocated the interviewee, asking permission to record the \\ninterview, informing them that all personally identifiable \\nTABLE 1.

We began the interview by asking: “I want to start by \\nlearning a bit more about you. What software products, at \\nMicrosoft and elsewhere, have you worked on?” This helped us \\nto establish rapport and facilitated informants’ reflections; this \\nprior history was later removed during transcriptions to preserve \\nanonymity. We then asked: “Think back to someone you've \\nworked with that you thou ght was a great software engineer. \\nWhat were some attributes that made the person 'great' in your \\nmind?” We asked follow -up and clarification questions for \\nattributes that we thought were interesting (e.g. novel, vague, or \\ncounter to prior informants). \\nIn the second part of the interview, we asked about attributes \\nthat either lacked clarity or (we thought) might vary in \\ninterpretation. As we learned more a bout the attributes from \\ninterviewees, we updated the set of attributes we inquired about \\n(once every ~10 interviews). For time considerations, we limited \\nour discussions to 5 attributes of interest. We closed the \\ninterview by restating the purpose of the research and asking \\ninterviewees whether they had anything else to add. \\nTo analyze the more than 60 hours of interviews and 388,000 \\nwords of transcripts, we used a grounded theory approach [29]. \\nWe began with open coding , identifying and assessing all \\nexcerpts that discussed attributes of great software engineers. \\nOnce we developed our initial attributes, descrip tions, and \\ngroupings, we made a selective coding pass through our data —\\nconsolidating the attribute set. To validate our interpretations, \\nwe then solicited the help of a Senior S oftware Development \\nEngineer (3rd author) to analyze roughly 1/3 of the intervi ews, \\ndeveloping her own attributes, definitions, and groupings, and \\nthen consolidating with the initial set. We made a final pass \\nthrough all transcripts to produce the final set of attributes. \\nIV. \\xa0FINDINGS \\nOur analysis identified a diverse set of 53 attribute s of great \\nsoftware engineers. At a high level, our informants described \\ngreat engineers as people who are passionate about their jobs and \\nare continuously improving; who develop and maintain practical \\ndecision-making models based on theory and experience;  who \\ngrow their capability to produce software that are elegant, \\ncreative, and anticipate needs; who evaluate tradeoffs at multiple \\nlevels of abstraction, from low -level technical details to big -\\npicture strategies; and whom teammates trust and enjoy working \\nwith.  \\nTo give readers a sense of how the attributes interconnect, \\nwe present a model of the 53 attributes in Fig 1. We organize the \\nattributes into internal attributes of the engineer’s personality \\nand ability to make effective decisions, as  well as external \\nattributes of the impact that great engineers have on people and \\nproduct. Making effective decisions involved recognizing \\nsituations as well as knowing alternative courses of action, likely \\noutcomes, and values of outcomes.  The e xternal attributes \\nfocused on great engineers applying their emotional intelligence \\nand decision-making models to their software, their teammates, \\nand the potentially millions of users and stakeholders they serve \\nvia their software engineering efforts.  \\nMany of the  attributes are applicable to many profession s, \\nand some, to simply being a good person. Our objective was to \\nidentify, among all possibl e attributes, the set that expert \\nsoftware engineers viewed as important  for the engineering of \\nsoftware. More importantly, we aim ed to provide  a \\ncontextualized understanding of why these  attributes are \\nimportant in real-world practice.  \\nIn the rest of this section, w e provide a description of each \\nattribute and quotes from informants (including their title and \\ndivision when this information would not reveal their identity)  \\nthat capture the sentiment  in interviews. Due to space \\nlimitations, we focus detailed descriptions on attributes that we \\nfelt— based on prior work— were particularly interesting.  \\nA. \\xa0Personal Characteristics  \\nInformants mentioned 18 attributes of engineers’ \\npersonalities (see Table 2). With attributes like passionate and \\ncurious, these concerned who great engineers were as people. \\nFor many  a ttributes, informants felt that the attributes were \\nintrinsic to the engineer — formed through their upbringing —\\nand were difficult (if not impossible) to change.  \\n  \\nFig. 1.

Informants \\nbelieved that engineers did not start their careers being great, but \\nthat young engineers needed to learn and improve. In formants \\nalso felt that because the software field was rapidly changing and \\nevolving, unless engineers kept learning, they would not become \\nand would not continue to be great software engineers. This \\nnotion of running up an infinite escalator was prevalent among \\ninformants: \\n“Computer technology, compared to other sciences or technology, it 's pretty \\nyoung.

Informants felt that \\nsoftware engineering required a tight fit b etween a person's \\npassion and the project to achieve high quality: \\n“I think that there are people who are great software engineers who are in the \\nwrong place and aren't motivated and they end up not performing well .” -\\nPrincipal Dev Lead, Dynamics \\nThere was also a sentiment that no matter the subject matter, \\nthere will be someone with a natural affinity towards it: \\n“I found that there's always a person who's passionate about every type of \\nthing, you just have to find the right people… I ended up in the wrong  job for \\nsix months.

Informants \\nfelt that outcomes in software engineering (e.g. user reactions \\nand commercial success) were difficult to predict: \\n“You should be open… what you think need not be the right thing tomorrow… \\nlike the Facebook explo sion, when Myspace was already there, but it \\nexploded… no one knew that Facebook would explode when it started”. -\\nSenior SDE, Windows Services  \\nTABLE 2.

Great engineers not only \\nknew what should happen, but also what can and likely will  \\nhappen.  \\nTo make effective decisions, o ur informants d iscussed \\nengineers needing knowledge about context along several \\ndimensions— technical domain , customers and business , tools \\nand building materials , and engineering practices — as \\nfoundational to engineering decisions .

You \\nhave to do that both down and up and out.”  -Principal Dev Lead, Phone \\n2) \\xa0 Sees the Forest and the Trees  \\nInformants described great engineers as seeing the forest and \\nthe trees, considering situations at multiple levels of abstraction, \\nincluding technical details, industry trends, company vision, and \\ncustomer/business needs. Informants indicated that mental \\nmodels could exist at various levels  and that great engineers \\nreasoned at all levels quickly and accurately: \\n“What differentiated [this great engineer] from other people in management \\npositions… capability to zoom into the details, and he was not just a high level \\nguy, …know the reality of the stack or the reality of the software…” -Senior \\nDev Lead, Ad Platform \\nInformants felt that this ability enabled great engineers to \\nmake globally optimal decisions, avoiding local optimizations: \\n“The challenge is having the ability to look at things from many different \\nperspectives, at many different levels of abstraction or detail. Then, being able \\nto choose how to lay things out …  make a set of choices.”  -Technical Fellow \\n(division removed to preserve anonymity) \\n3) \\xa0 Update Their Mental Models  \\nInformants described great engineers as continuously \\nupdating their menta l models  at all levels of abstraction —\\nranging from technical details to industry trends— by explicitly \\nevaluating changes in their context. Related to being open-\\nminded, this attribute concerned the process of updating mental \\nmodels, sometimes discarding existing models for new ones: \\n“You can always follow patterns too much. .. It's worked in the past, but \\nconditions have changed. You always need to look and take a little bit of risk \\nwith each one of your tasks. If you're not then you're not really going to f ind \\nout what's possible.” -Principal Dev Lead, Office \\nImportant contextual changes discussed by informants were \\ncommonly shifts in long -held understandings in software. \\nInformants felt that these foundational shifts and their \\nimplications were critical for  great engineers to understand and \\nadapt to: \\n“Sometimes what used to be a second or third order effect comes to dominate . \\nSo way back in the day, if you wanted to performance optimize something you \\ncounted instructions. Processors got faster and faster, but memory references \\ndidn't. There became a day when it made more sense to count memory \\nreferences than it did to count instructions. Unless you're conscious of when \\nthose things will intersect, you'll be on the wrong side of history and be \\nfrustrated.” -Technical Fellow (division removed to preserve anonymity) \\n4) \\xa0 Handling Complexity  \\nMany informants described great engineers as handling \\ncomplexity with ease, grasping and reasoning about complex \\nand intertwining ideas with agility. Informants felt that some \\nsoftware problems were inherently complex. This might have \\nbeen especially salient at Microsoft, where products commonly \\nbuild on top of multiple layers of technologies and interact with \\nmany other components. Building an accurate mental model of \\ndependencies and connections was seen as critical: \\n“To solve the problem, [great engineers] have to have the ability to connect \\nthings… You are always debugging layers of stacks of code… this layer talks \\nto some other layer in the horizontal... you need to solve the pr oblem and you \\ndon't know what's going on.” -Senior SDE, Windows Services  \\nSome informants felt that the ability to handle complexity \\nwas a natural ability. Others felt that great engineers could \\neffectively augment their natural abilities using tools and \\nprocesses (e.g. externalizing knowledge by writing it down): \\n“Ability to capture… simulate the architecture in their head… there's probably \\na little bit of innate skill and cognitive ability… That said, the fact that you \\ndon't have that skill doesn't mean that there's no other ways of doing it that \\nmay be more brute force… writing things down and studying very carefully \\nthe architecture you've put down is putting the brute force time into studying \\na problem.” -Partner Dev Lead, Windows \\nC. \\xa0Teammates \\nInformants me ntioned 17 attributes of  engineers’ \\ninteractions with teammates (see Table 4). Informants felt that \\ngreat engineers were expected to positively impact teammates. \\nFor many informants, this was an important part of their job as \\nleads or managers.  \\nAttributes in this area revolved around four concepts: being \\na reasonable person, being a good leader, communicating \\neffectively, and building trust. We discuss, in detail,  attributes \\nrelated to communicating effectively and building trust, as these \\nconcepts are frequently mentioned in the literature but often with \\nlittle contextual understanding.  \\n1) \\xa0 Creates Shared Context  \\nInformants felt that creating shared context, which involved \\nmolding another person’s understanding of a situation, was the \\nmost important  aspect of “communicating effectively”. This \\ninvolved tailoring the message to another person’s perspective: \\n“You perceive who you are talking to, and you are able to judge on those levels \\nthat they are, or you just ask important questions. Do you know abo ut this? \\nAnd then, be able to simplify the problem to the level that they’re working in, \\nor you estimate the amount of information given to them.” -Senior SDE, \\nWindows \\nThis sentiment is closely related to the concept of \\n“grounding” proposed by Clark and Brennan, which, when done \\nsuccessfully, required parties to “coordinate the content and the \\nprocess” of communication  [30]. Since the engineering of \\nsoftware involves many people, getting everyone to have a \\nshared understanding was seen as essential to success: \\n“One person can only accomplish so much so you've always got to be working \\nas part of the bigger group. People who can't communicate are only going to \\nbe sort of so-so effective… ” -Principal Dev Lead, Corp Dev \\nInformants also stated that great engineers, especially ones \\nat higher-levels, often had to communicate with people that do \\nnot have a complete (or the same) understanding of the situation \\nbut are critical to success (e.g. partner teams , customers, or \\nmanagement). Therefore, crafting the message such that other s \\ncan comprehend the situation was important: \\n“Our areas where the things are inherently difficult to talk about… business \\npartners or with a customer…  When you go outside and you talk to customers, \\nthey think about things in much different terms and so in some ways you have \\nto kind of switch gears… why you should care about it and here is how you \\nshould think about it.” -Principal Dev Lead, Corp Dev \\n2) \\xa0 Creates Shared Success  \\nInformants described great engineers as creating shared \\nsuccess for everyone involved, possibly involving personal \\ncompromises. Informants felt that software engineering was a \\ncollaborative process, requiring many people, often  with \\ndifferent personal motivations and organizational objectives . \\nGreat engineers needed to get everyone making decisions \\naligned to a shared goal: \\n705\\n705\\n705\\nICSE 2015, Florence, Italy\"),\n",

A lot \\nof time I see our support to our client is not very well  [sic]… we should have \\na good result combined together.” -Senior SDE, Phone \\nMany informants said  that great engineers made shared \\nsuccess bidirectional between managers and individual \\ncontributors. Managers needed to put engineers in positions to \\nsucceed; great engineers needed to engage management to \\nfacilitate mutual success. Great engineers often had better \\nunderstandings of the details; managers often had a broader \\nperspective of the situation: \\n“It's a two -way communication… there's something going to happen down the \\nroad, this piece of code or this feature going to have some issues, need to make \\nyour manager aware.” -SDE2, Phone \\nThis attribute likely helped to avoid dysfunctional ‘time \\nfamine’ situations as discussed by Perlow  [31], where crises \\narise in teams due to a lack of shared understanding about status \\nand objectives.  \\n3) \\xa0 Creates A Safe Haven  \\nMany informants described great engineers as creating a safe \\nhaven where other engineers can learn and improve from \\nmistakes and situations without negative consequences. Usually \\nassociated with leaders , informants felt that if engineers are \\nafraid of mistakes, then their growth would slow: \\n“Chasing after a career path or somet hing… you will deliver your best \\nperformance if you are not insecure… One of the challenges as a man ager \\npeople face these days is retaining talent because there is so much attrition \\nall over.” -Senior Dev Lead, Ad Platform \\nInformants also saw the lack of this attribute as a major \\ncontributing factor for talent loss. Informants did not want to \\nwork in environments where they felt insecure, and often \\navoided those teams/organizations: \\n“If you make one mistake or don’t know something and you’re sort of dinged  \\nby that… and you’re only judged if you say everything’s perfect even if it \\nisn’t… Then you start to have this really kind of I think dysfunctional \\nenvironment set up where everybody just doesn’t say the truth.” - Principal \\nDev Manager, Windows Services  \\nTABLE 4.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'what-makes-a-great-software-engineer.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=' \\nThough informants felt that safe havens were important, \\nmany expressed the need to balance a safe environment with \\nfeeling the pain of mistakes. The reasoning was that pain from \\nmistakes was the best teacher: if an engineer was hurt by \\nsomething, then the engineer quickly learned to avoid it: \\n“I believe in having people feel the pain of their own mistakes… dealing with \\nthe ramifications of the decisions that are being made, I guess is the best way \\nto learn.” -Principal Dev Lead, Office  \\n4) \\xa0 Honest \\nInformants felt that being honest was the most important \\nattribute related to ‘trust’. This was about great engineers \\nproviding credible information. Engineers that presented a \\nversion of the situation that suited their own benefit s were \\nviewed negatively. Informants felt that they needed to be able to \\ntake action based on information that an engineer provided: \\n“Influence comes to someone else trusting you, part of that trust is that they go, \\n‘You know what? I know that this person always speaks the truth.’ As a result \\nof that, when they say something is good, I will totally believe them because \\nthey are not trying to kind of misrepresent something or make them look better \\nor whatever.” -Windows Services Principal Dev Manager  \\nInformants also did not appreciate wasting time shifting the \\nblame for problems. They felt that great engineers focused the ir \\nattention and efforts on addressing the problem: \\n“Rather than thinking about how to actually fix the problem at hand, [other \\nengineers were] more like \"How do I make sure that nobody will come back \\nand think that maybe that happened because of something  that I might have \\ndone?\" [This great engineer] has a way of kind of saying: It doesn\\'t \\nmatter…What matters is right now. How do we actually work through it?” -\\nSenior SDE, Windows  \\nD. \\xa0Software Product \\nInformants mentioned 9 attributes regarding the software \\nthat great engineers produced (se e Table 5 ). Like artists \\nappreciating masterpieces of other artists, our informants, many \\nof whom are great engineers themselves, saw beauty in the \\nsoftware produced by other great engineers. \\n1) \\xa0 Elegant \\nInformants described software of great engineers as elegant: \\npossessing simple and intuitive designs that another person (or \\nthemselves later) could easily understand. Among all software -\\nrelated attributes, elegance was the most revered. Informants \\nrecognized that some problems i n software were complex and \\nhighly constrained, making it difficult to have a simple solution \\nthat met the requirements: \\n“The style… always , an idea, and it was  all clean… very concise. Just looking \\nat it, you can say, \"Okay, this guy, he knew what he was doing.\"… There\\'s no \\nextra stuff. Everything is minimally necessary and sufficient as it should be. \\nIt\\'s well thought-out off screen.” - Windows, Senior SDE  \\nInformants also felt that it was critical to avoid complexity. \\nComplex solutions increased the likelihood of bugs and \\nincreased maintenance costs (if problems were fixable at all). \\nEvolving the software was also more costly when the design was \\nbrittle to change: \\n“Never complicate any things… when you simplify things it becomes easier for \\nyou to maintain , going forward for customers … You get lesser number of \\nissues reported by a customer.” -Senior Dev Lead, Dynamics \\n2) \\xa0 Creative \\nMany informants described the software of great engineers \\nas creative, involving novel solutions based on understanding of \\nthe constraints of the context, existing solutions, and the \\nlimitations of existing solutions. Informants felt that there were \\ntwo important parts to having creative solutions. First, great \\nengineers understood constraints and requirements of the \\nparticular context/problem: \\n“If you\\'re looking for really an innovative … or just a solution that’s outside the \\ncurrent norm… think through the problem…constraints that are current ly \\nimposed on the environment.”  -Principal SDE Lead, Windows \\nSecond, great engineers knew of and knew when to apply \\nexisting solutions (and  not be creative). This was important \\nbecause informants felt that known solutions were generally \\npreferable since they were less costly and less error-prone: \\n“You are now using all of your creativity to reinvent things that are already \\ninvented and that is just basically wasteful .”-Principal Dev Manager, \\nWindows Services \\nStill, m ost informants felt that novel problems occurred \\nfrequently in software engineering, needing great engineers with \\nthe ability to come up with innovative solutions:  \\nTABLE 5: GREAT SOFTWARE ENGINEERS’ SOFTWARE AND DESIGNS.

Doing something well \\nand in a very simple way is very very hard.” -Principal Dev Lead, Bing  \\nCreative—novel solutions based on understanding of the \\ncontext, existing solutions, and the limitations of existing \\nsolutions. \\n“Think outside the box… here\\'s a traditional solution… often have constraints...take the difficult \\ncircumstance and actually make it into something that could actually still work, but without a \\nhuge complex overhead.” -Senior SDE, Principal Dev Lead  \\nAnticipates needs— producing software that \\naccommodate likely needs and problems based on \\ncontextual knowledge \\n“Think where you\\'re going to get into trouble potentially… What are we ultimately trying to do, \\nand what can I do today that will save me time over the lifetime of the system?” -Technical \\nFellow, division removed to preserve anonymity  \\nMakes tradeoffs—making trade -offs (e.g. quality for time to \\nmarket) based on the context and the situation.  \\n“Weight the tradeoffs.

How your code is supposed \\nto work…  if I tweaked this here I’m not going to break something else.” -Senior Dev Lead, Xbox \\nEvolving—structure the software to be efficiently delivered \\niteratively or in pieces. \\n“A very clean step -wise process moving forward… how can we break this down so that we have \\nreally concrete deliverables on an ongoing basis.” -Senior Dev Lead, Bing \\nLong-termed—acting with an eye towards the future, not  just \\nshort term gratification. \\n“A bunch of isolated, fragmented, short -term solutions together, what do you get? Not something \\ngreat. Definitely, someone needs to have this long -term vision and say: we make decisions not \\nbased on the immediate problem…” -Partner Dev Manager, Corp Dev  \\nCarefully constructed—using the right processes (e.g. unit \\ntesting) to produce the software. \\n“Unit testing, of the code.

It now has hundreds of millions of users . That \\nsystem was designed fifteen years ago, when QQ only had a few million users. \\nIt still works today, that’s amazing, to hav e a system that scales that well, to \\nforesee all the issues it would have to face.”  -SDE2, Severs & Tools \\nMore than any other attribute, informants discussed the \\npropensity to overly anticipat e needs in the face of uncertainty, \\nincurring high costs to add unneeded flexibility. Some thought \\nthat any prediction of the future was foolish and preferred to \\ndesign for current needs and being open to rewrites: \\n“‘..Architect something now that's going to survive well 20 years from no w?’ \\nNobody is that smart to be able to predict the future that well , I will refactor \\ntowards new requirements and I constantly do that.” -Senior SDE, Office \\nV. \\xa0THREATS TO VALIDITY \\nAs with any empirical study, our results are subject to \\nvarious threats to validity. There are threats to th e construct \\nvalidity from the lack of a clea r and shared definition of a \\n‘software engineer’. Though, in general, informants understood \\nthat we meant people that wrote code to be used by customers , \\nand we clarified whenever there was confusion . Our interview \\nand analysis processes contain threats to internal validity. \\nInformants could generally only mention a few salient attributes \\nunprompted; given more time  to think , informants may have \\nproduced more attributes.  Moreover, while our analysis was \\nsystematic, other researchers may discern different attributes, \\ndefinitions, or models than ours . Our sampling method also \\ncontain threats to external validity. Though o ur 59 interviews \\nyielded rich insights, it was a small sample, even for Microsoft, \\nwhich employs tens of thousands of engineers. This led to some \\nnatural biases, such as underrepresentation of women; we had \\nonly 3 among our 59 informants. In addition, we only sampled \\nengineers in Seattle, USA. Findings may not generalize to other \\ncultures, especially attributes associated with management. The \\nsize of the organization may also affect generalizability , \\nespecially for attributes related to people and organizations . \\nMicrosoft also had an established set of practic es, tools, and \\nproducts; findings may not generalize to other situations (e.g. \\nstart-ups). Microsoft is a software -centric company; informants \\ndiscussed unfavorable conditions in non-software centric \\nindustries, like finance and retail. It is unclear whether the same \\nattributes (or their standards) would generalize.  Nonetheless, \\nsince Microsoft is a successful organization that  produces \\nsoftware used by billions, findings are relevant and interesting.  \\nVI. \\xa0DISCUSSION  \\nOverall, nearly all of the attributes of great software \\nengineers we uncovered have been mentioned to some degree in \\nprior work , e.g. [1][3][27], and many attributes overlap with \\nones important to other professions , e.g. [11][21]. Our results, \\nhowever, are the first time a comprehensive set of attributes for \\nsoftware engineering has been identified and described . In \\naddition, t here are several important implications. First,  our \\nresults suggest that  productivity is only one criterion for \\nexcellence. How the engineering is conducted, relative to  \\nmanagement (e.g. managing expectations ), subordinates (e.g. \\ncreating a safe haven), teammates (e.g. asking for help), partners \\n(e.g. creating shared success ), and even oneself (e.g. \\nperseverant), are all critical. This reinforces the perspective that \\nsoftware engineering is  a sociotechnical undertaking, and not \\njust a technical one . Furthermore, simply delivering the code is \\nalso in sufficient. With attributes like elegant, creative, long-\\ntermed, and seeing the forest and the trees , our results indicate \\nthat good software engineering requires engineers to make \\ncomplex, experienced-driven, contextual considerations.  \\nSecond, though rarely discussed in the software engineering \\nliterature, results suggest that effective decision-making is \\ncritical. Informants felt that there are usually myriad options—\\nnot all good— for what to do and how to do it. And as engineers \\ngrow in their careers, they are tasked with making decisions in \\nincreasingly more complex and ambiguous situations, often with \\nsignificant ramifications. Making effective decisions , entailing \\nattributes in Section IV.B  as well as other sections , is an \\nimportant skill for engineers to develop.  \\nThird, results suggest that being able to learn new technical \\nskills is likely more important than any indiv idual technical \\nskills. Informants, even ones in the same division, use d diverse \\ntechnologies— sometimes project specific tools (e.g. Cosmos, a \\nMicrosoft version of Had oop). There was no consensus on any \\nspecific technical topic (e.g. architecture) as being essential. \\nRather, most informants stressed needing to learn new skills (i.e. \\ncontinuously improving ) and nearly all viewed it as a critical \\nattribute of great engineers. \\nThe attributes we have identified  and described ma y have \\nwide-ranging implications for researchers, novice engineers, \\nmanagers, and educators. In the rest of this section , we discuss \\nimplications and opportunities to build upon our results. \\nA. \\xa0For Researchers  \\nOur findings raise important questions about our  current \\nunderstanding of what affects  software engineering  outcomes. \\nMuch of the prior work on this topic focuses on process es [32], \\ncost-estimation (e.g.  COCOMO [33]), coordination [34], and \\nrequirements engineering [35]. While many of the attributes we \\nuncovered underlie these concerns, such as creating shared \\ncontext and carefully constructed, there are also others that have \\nnot been considered , such as aligned, creates a safe haven , and \\nfits. These likely reflect higher-level concerns such as  \\nindividuality, organizations, and productization. \\nOur results also suggest several new directions for tools \\nresearch. For example, we are not aware of any tools that help \\nengineers be more well-mannered in emails or evaluate tradeoffs \\nand see the forest and the trees when making decisions . Tools \\nresearch may explore facilitating and training engineers, \\nespecially novices, in these attributes  \\n708\\n708\\n708\\nICSE 2015, Florence, Italy\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'what-makes-a-great-software-engineer.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=' \\nAn important part of better understanding these attributes  is \\ndeveloping measur ements that operationalize these attributes . \\nThese may enable rigorous science to better understand how the \\nattributes vary and their effects on teams  and outcomes. Such \\nmeasurements may also form a critical foundation for managers \\nto identify and cultivate talent, for novice s to improve, and for \\neducators to assess learning outcomes.  \\nB. \\xa0For Novice Engineers  \\nNew software engineers are often unsure of how to become \\ngreat engineer s [1]. Our findings enumerate a set of attributes \\nthat they might aspire to achieve. Improvements might come \\nfrom trainings, projects at work, mentoring, or self -adjustments \\n(e.g. for personality traits). Researchers might also investigate \\ninterventions that help achieve the attributes quickly and \\neffectively.  \\nFurthermore, novice engineers may also use our results to \\nassess the ir fit with prospective employers . As mentioned in \\nSection IV.A.2  on passionate, the fit of the engineer with the \\nproject is critical . Novice engineers might assess the ir fit, in \\nterms of the attributes they value, with a prospective team.  \\nOur findings may also help novices better present themselves \\nto employers. Since experienced engineers and managers value \\nthese attributes, novice engineers might consider demonstrating \\nto employers that they have or can develop these attributes. This \\nalso extends to highlighting the qualities when authoring their \\nresumes or presenting themselves in interviews. \\nC. \\xa0For Managers \\nOur informants discussed many attributes that were \\nimportant for engineers in senior and leadership positions, such \\nas mentoring, raising challenges, and walking-the-walk. N ew \\nresearch may explore ways to help engineers improve these \\nattributes to become better managers. \\nBeyond improving themselves, our results may also help \\nmanagers make more effective hiring decisions. Managers may \\nbetter identify candidates that fit the culture and context of the \\nteam. They may also better avoid engineers without the \\nattributes, such as not aligned (off doing their own projects), not \\nwell-mannered (being an ‘ass’, as many engineers described it), \\nor not asking for help.  \\nFinally, our results strongly suggest that managers may \\nconsider cultivating the attributes within their teams. Managers \\nmay consider using the findings — with help from further \\nresearch— to build a culture that is conducive to attracting, \\nproducing, and retaining great engineers. \\nD. \\xa0For Educators \\nOur findings also raise significant questions about \\ncurriculum choices, teaching methods, and learning objectives  \\nin formal computer science and software engineering education. \\nEducators may consider adding courses on topics not found in \\ntheir current curricula. For example, we found decision making \\nto be a key part o f software engineering, but this  specific topic \\nis not a part of the ACM’s Computing Curricula [6]. A course \\nspecifically about decision making (e.g. discussing Simon’s \\nmodel of rational choice [36], Klein’s naturalistic decision-\\nmaking approach [37], or case studies of software engineering \\ndecisions), might be valuable to students.  \\nSoftware engineering educators might also use our results to \\nexamine their teaching methods . Most attributes of great \\nengineers focus on how rather than what, whereas most \\ninstructions in software engineering focus on teaching skills and \\nknowledge (the what), such as prior work on tools for automated \\ntesting and analysis . Educators might consider improving how \\nsoftware engineering  goals are attained.  For example, existing \\nproject-based courses might use attributes presented in this paper \\nto help student evaluate each other’s behavior, as well as grading \\nnon-functional attributes of the code, such as elegance, \\nanticipates needs, and creative.  \\nFinally, educators might consider explicitly discussing what \\nstudents will not learn in school, allowing them to be aware of \\npotential knowledge gaps and empower them to seek out \\nopportunities outside of the academic setting (e.g. internships or \\nopen-source projects).  For example, attributes like self-reliant \\nmay not be reasonable to teach in an academic setting and might \\nbe better learned through mentorship on the job ; nevertheless, \\neducators should consider informing students that it is a critical \\ncomponent of software engineering expertise. \\nVII. \\xa0FUTURE WORK \\nThough this paper is a good start at better understanding \\nsoftware engineering expertise, there are countless opportunities \\nfor future work.  The c ombinations of attributes that are \\ninteresting or prevalent could be examined. Each specific \\nattribute we uncovered in this study could also be the subject of \\nfuture empirical studies  to provide deeper and more nuanced \\ndefinitions, approaches for measurement, or assessments of \\nimpacts on software engineering outcomes. Comparison of the \\nattributes of software engineering expertise to attributes in other \\nfields could provide more insights into the unique qualities of \\nthe software engineering phenomenon.  \\nOur results provide little insight into the relative importance \\nof the attributes (e.g.  weighting or criticality) and the effects of \\ncontextual factors (e.g. gender  or background ). We did not \\nconduct an analysis for those insights for our interview study \\nbecause it would have lacked validity. We did not ask informants \\nabout all the attributes, and informants often agreed or amended \\ntheir thinking when prompted with attributes from other \\ninterviews. Future studies can examine this rich area.  \\nWith studies like these and the many others that our findings \\nprovoke, our research community can begin to understand \\nsoftware engineering not just as a purely technical discipline of \\ntools and processes, but a sociotechnical one, with individual \\nhuman contributors and their  collaborations fueling software \\nprogress. \\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \\nThis work was supported in part by Microsoft, Google, and \\nthe National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grants CCF -\\n0952733, CNS-1240786, and IIS -1314399.
